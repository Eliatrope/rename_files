# rename_files
Rename your files not easily.

I created this shitty tool for a summer job. I had to rename a bunch of files and I didn't want to do it one by one. So I developed this lil thing to help me. You'll find the original file in this repo (index.php) with a lot of annoying parameters (like min/max attributes on input) but feel free to change them.

So, to use this "native" lil thing, you need an archive (.zip) with some images inside.
Tap in the text area your new names (with a space between each file names) and let's go.

After this part, a summary is here and you can, if you want, change a last time, before the rename occuring, the names (use the input beside of the files to do it).

You will find your renamed files into the repo' /images.

I know, the code is pretty ugly and a bulk of bugs shall remain and crawl ; i'll post a v374545 when the motivation arises...
